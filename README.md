# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.
These currencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and held by currency holders. Additionally, units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers, then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.

We are tasked to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. Since there is no known output, we will be using unsupervised machine learning to help create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm and then use data visualizations to share our findings.
